All segments showed a good performance in provision expense.\n",

The mortgage and consumer loan portfolios  declined  due  to  the  strengthening  of  origination  policies  and  lower  dynamics  in  credit  cards  and  unsecured investment products. The commercial loan portfolio had stable growth of 0.04%. In terms of funding, there was a reduction of 2.7% due to the decline in time deposits from individuals and institutional clients, as well as sight deposits due to seasonality in the last quarter.\n",

       "Banistmo recorded a net profit of COP 86.5 billion in 1Q25, increasing by 3,506.5% quarterly. Net interest income decreased due to the decreasing revenue from commercial loans, partially offset by lower interest expenses due to the reduction in time deposit balances. Provisions decreased due to parameters update in the mortgage portfolio, better performance in all the segments, and successful collection strategies. Operating expenses also decreased, although labor expenses increased due to higher bonuses. The net interest margin was 3.1% and the quarterly annualized ROE reached 7.4%.\n",

This increase was mainly due to higher net interest income generation, driven by growth in treasury income due to a higher  volume  of  US  Treasury  bonds  and,  to  a  lesser  extent,  higher  portfolio  interest  income.  Additionally,  there  was  a reduction in interest expenses associated with a decrease in loans from financial institutions and bonds. Net commissions decreased due to lower transaction volumes compared to the last quarter of the year. Net provisions for the period increased due to the growth of the portfolio in higher-risk segments. Operating expenses decreased as spending normalized following the elevated levels observed in the year-end quarter.

       "Bam's loan portfolio closed the first quarter of 2025 with a quarterly growth of 0.7% in USD. This increase was mainly driven by the commercial loan portfolio in the  corporate segment. In the consumer segment, although there was an increase in credit cards, the total balance ended with a slight decrease. Meanwhile, the mortgage loan portfolio showed marginal growth of 0.1% at the end of the quarter. Regarding the funding structure, favorable dynamics were observed in savings accounts, especially in the business segment. However, there was a decrease in time deposits and checking account balances.\n",
       "\n",
       "The net result for Bam in 1Q25 was a profit of COP 20.8 billion. Net interest income decreased compared to the previous quarter due to lower interest generation in the commercial and consumer loan portfolios. This decrease was partially offset by higher income from treasury operations, driven by the appreciation of the investment portfolio, as well as lower interest expenses. Provisions showed a lower expense explained mostly by the business segment. Operating expenses decreased due to the seasonality of the first quarter of the year, which tends to have lower expenses compared to the last quarter. Bam's net interest margin for the first quarter of 2025 was 4.6%, and the quarterly annualized ROE was 3.82%.\n",
